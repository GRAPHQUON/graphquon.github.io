        <!-- Introduction -->
        <section class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Welcome</h2>
            <p class="mt-4">
                All are welcome at the event. We expect all community members to act in accordance with this code of conduct, which is anchored in the belief that the Computer Graphics community thrives on the diversity of its members. The free exchange of ideas is essential to a successful conference and research community. 
                Our intention is to create a space where every participant can express themselves without fear of judgment or harassment.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
                Should you feel threatened or unsafe, please reach out to the organizer. We will address your concerns promptly.

        <section class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Moderation Guidelines</h2>
            <p class="mt-4">We encourage participants to work out disagreements or misunderstandings amongst themselves first. If this is not effective, please inform an event organizer.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">Comments, posts, or discussions deemed as harassment will be removed by the organizational team. We trust participants to conduct themselves professionally, but the following steps will be taken if necessary:</p>
            <ul class="list-decimal list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> First-time offending posts or comments will be removed or not approved if applicable.</li>
                <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> Continued violations will result in a private conversation with a team member to explain the infraction and consequences.</li>
                <li><strong>Level 3:</strong> Further violations will result in the participant being banned from the event spaces (e.g., Zoom, Discord). Their identity and infractions will be reported to the organizer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4">
                For egregious first-time offenses, the organizing team reserves the right to ban a participant immediately.
